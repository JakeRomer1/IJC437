The contents of this repository includes R code and an Excel file. The code was written in order to investigate the finances of different Train Operators. The two research questions identified in the report were:
1. What factors allow Train Operators to be profitable?
2. What factors cause Train Operators to be unprofitable?

Running this code will provide the visualisations created in order to carry out the analysis for the report. There are seven visualisations in total, with these being:
1. Income vs Expenditure
2. Staff Costs
3. Rolling Stock Costs
4. Fare Income
5. Average Number of Passenger Per Train
6. Number of Trains Per KM of Operation
7. Subsidy Amount

The findings of the report are that fixed costs are the main difference between profitable Train Operators and unprofitable Train Operators

How to run:
1. Download R file
2. Download the Excel file 'RTraindata.xlsx' into your Documents
3. Run R file
4. If the line 'trains <- read_excel("~/RTraindata.xlsx")' is not working, check that Excel file has been correctly downloaded and stored
